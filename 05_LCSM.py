  Problem
    A common substring of a collection of strings is a substring of every
    member of the collection. We say that a common substring is a longest
    common substring if there does not exist a longer common substring.
    For example, "CG" is a common substring of "ACGTACGT" and "AACCGTATA",
    but it is not as long as possible; in this case, "CGTA" is a longest common
    substring of "ACGTACGT" and "AACCGTATA".

    Note that the longest common substring is not necessarily unique; for a
    simple example, "AA" and "CC" are both longest common substrings of "AACC"
    and "CCAA".

  Given: A collection of k (kâ‰¤100) DNA strings of length at most 1 kbp each in
    FASTA format.

  Return: A longest common substring of the collection. (If multiple solutions
    exist, you may return any single solution.)
